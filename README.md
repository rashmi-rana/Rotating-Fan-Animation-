# Rotating-Fan-Animation-
 Rotating Fan Animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Description:
I created a simple yet visually appealing rotating fan animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The fan blades rotate smoothly and continuously, giving a realistic effect. The animation is achieved by applying CSS animations to the fan blades and controlling the rotation speed with JavaScript.
